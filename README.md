# About
Game made in one week using Unity and exported for WebGL, with art assets made from Kenney to practice a bit.

Assets used: https://www.kenney.nl/assets/space-shooter-redux

The breakable rock was made using and adapting a script from Hector Pulido with the addition of the Advanced Polygon Collider.
